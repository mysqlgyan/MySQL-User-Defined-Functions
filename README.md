MySQL-User-Defined-Functions


A curated set of MySQL stored functions (UDFs in SQL) that solve everyday string and utility needs—e.g., capitalize the first letter of a string, reverse a string without using built-ins, and more.

Highlights

- Pure MySQL 8.0-compatible SQL (most functions also work on 5.7).
- Lightweight, copy–paste friendly.
- Clear naming and parameter conventions.
- Each function includes example usage and simple tests.
